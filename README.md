## Why "Calculator"? <a name="why-calculator"></a>
* This is a product I used to attend the Sun* scholarship.
* I have already had a simple mobile app product in Dart language but I want to challenge myself with new things.
* While studying, I am curious and interested in the things we use everyday, for example a calculator.
* Calculator is a product that we use a lot everyday so I would like to know better about how it came to be.
* In a short amount of time, I finally built a basic computer.
* This is not a product of high difficulty, but I think that by understanding what I am using and knowing the needs of use, I can develop new and necessary products.
* The product still has some drawbacks. So I'm looking forward to getting some feedback.
* Thank you for your interest in this product
