## Why "Calculator"? <a name="why-calculator"></a>
* This is a product I used to attend the Sun* scholarship.
* I already have a simple mobile app product in dart language but I want to challenge myself with newer things.
* In the process of self-studying and studying at school, I am curious and interested in the things we use every day like a calculator.
* Computational calculator is a product that we use a lot every day so I would like to know better how it came to be.
* In a short amount of time, I finally built a basic computer.
* This is not a product of high difficulty, but I think that by understanding what I am using and knowing the needs of use, I can develop new and necessary products for myself. life.
* The product has many bad points. So I'm looking forward to getting some feedback.
* Thank you for your interest in this product.
